    <h2>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student in the Department of Applied Science, Physics Division, National Taitung University, focusing on <strong>efficiency improvement of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs)</strong>. I have experience in device structure optimization and thin film fabrication (such as spin-coating, evaporation), and am familiar with optoelectronic measurements (LJV, CE, EL) and data analysis.<br><br>
      I have also developed an <strong>automated paper push notification bot</strong> and a <strong>local paper Q&A system</strong>, combining Python and AI tools to enhance research efficiency.<br><br>
      In addition, I have participated in science education volunteer activities such as "Science Train," dedicated to making scientific knowledge accessible and practical, and have cultivated strong communication and teamwork skills.
